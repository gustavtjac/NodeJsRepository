Solve the basic Javascript exercises given in the repository.

[Introduction Exercises](./01._Introduction_Exercises)

You will also be able to find them in the Github Classroom.

**Hand-in**: Submit via Github Classroom (or hand in via Teams only if you cannot use Github Classroom):

Remember **NEVER** to submit files that should not be pushed into Git such as IDE specific files (`.vscode`, `.idea`) or `node_modules`. Add them to `.gitignore` if necessary.

**Deadline**: Note the time and date given in the Github Classroom assignment. Make sure that you look properly at the time. It is noon, not midnight.

## How to hand in

1. Accept the assignment in Github Classroom (link above)

2. You will receive an email. Click on the button that says `View invitation`.

6. This will automatically submit your assignment

## Can't hand-in?

It might be due to either doing something incorrect (ask in Teams) but it could also be due to a bug in GitHub Classroom. 

I have created an alternative Assignment in Teams.

We will assess how many are not able to hand in via GitHub Classroom and decide on where to do hand-ins for the rest of the course based on that.
